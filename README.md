# Thanksgiving Belly Buster

You're serving up Thanksgiving meals for your friends and family. Each guest's belly has a different limit for how many mouthfuls it can take. 

Your job is to load the plate until the mouthfuls of the food match what the belly can take. 

If you win and balance the plate and stomach, your guest gets pie. If you serve too much, your guest goes home with an upset stomach and no room for pie.
